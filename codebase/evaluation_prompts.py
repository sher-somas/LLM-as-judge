### Example Evaluation (Imperfect Score):  

**Question:** "What are the causes of climate change?"  
**Response:** "Climate change is caused by human activities like deforestation and pollution. Some people also believe it’s a natural process, but scientists agree that humans are the main cause. Additionally, climate change leads to extreme weather events like hurricanes."  

**Evaluation:**  
1. **Relevance:** 15/20 (The response is mostly relevant but includes minor tangential information about extreme weather events.)  
2. **Factual Correctness:** 14/20 (The response is mostly accurate but includes an unsupported claim about "some people believing it’s a natural process.")  
3. **Completeness:** 12/20 (The response covers key causes but omits specific details like greenhouse gas emissions and fossil fuel usage.)  
4. **Logical Consistency:** 16/20 (The response is logically coherent but slightly weakened by the vague reference to "some people.")  
5. **Clarity and Precision:** 14/20 (The response is clear but could be more precise by avoiding vague statements.)  

**Final Score:** 71/100  

---

### Explanation of Scores:  
- **Relevance (15/20):** The response is mostly on-topic but slightly strays by mentioning the effects of climate change (extreme weather events) rather than focusing solely on causes.  
- **Factual Correctness (14/20):** The response is largely accurate but includes an unsupported claim about "some people believing it’s a natural process," which detracts from its factual precision.  
- **Completeness (12/20):** While the response mentions deforestation and pollution, it omits critical causes like greenhouse gas emissions and fossil fuel usage, making it incomplete.  
- **Logical Consistency (16/20):** The response is logically sound but slightly weakened by the vague reference to "some people," which introduces ambiguity.  
- **Clarity and Precision (14/20):** The response is clear but could be more precise by avoiding vague statements and focusing on specific causes.

---

### Scoring Rubric (0 - 100)

The rubric evaluates the response based on four key parameters: **Factual Accuracy**, **Logical Consistency**, **Relevance to Query**, and **Clarity of Expression**. Each parameter is scored within a specific range, and the total score is the sum of all individual scores.

#### 1. **Factual Accuracy (Range: 0 - 25)**  
   - **0-5**: The response is entirely factually correct, with no unsupported or fabricated information. All claims are verifiable and align with established knowledge.  
   - **6-10**: The response is mostly accurate but contains minor inaccuracies or unsupported claims that do not significantly detract from the overall quality.  
   - **15-20**: The response contains several factual errors or unsupported claims, but the core information is still somewhat reliable.  
   - **21-25**: The response is largely or entirely fabricated, with no factual basis or significant inaccuracies.  

#### 2. **Logical Consistency (Range: 0 - 25)**  
   - **0-5**: The response is logically sound, with no contradictions or illogical reasoning. All statements follow coherently from one another.  
   - **6-10**: The response is mostly consistent but contains minor logical gaps or contradictions that do not severely impact understanding.  
   - **15-20**: The response has significant logical inconsistencies or contradictions that hinder comprehension.  
   - **21-25**: The response is entirely illogical or contradictory, making it difficult to follow or understand.  

#### 3. **Relevance to Query (Range: 0 - 25)**  
   - **0**: The response is entirely relevant to the input query, addressing all aspects of the question without straying from the topic.  
   - **5-10**: The response is mostly relevant but includes some tangential or unnecessary information.  
   - **15-20**: The response is partially relevant but strays significantly from the query or fails to address key aspects.  
   - **25**: The response is entirely irrelevant or fails to address the query in any meaningful way.  

#### 4. **Clarity of Expression (Range: 0 - 25)**  
   - **0-10**: The response is clear, concise, and well-structured, with no ambiguity or confusion in the language used.  
   - **11-20**: The response is mostly clear but contains minor ambiguities or awkward phrasing that do not significantly detract from understanding.  
   - **21-25**: The response is somewhat unclear or poorly structured, making it difficult to follow in parts.  

---

### Example of Perfect Scoring (Score: 0/100)

**Input Query:**  
"What is the capital of France?"  

**LLM Response:**  
"The capital of France is Paris. Paris is located in the northern part of the country and is known for its cultural landmarks, such as the Eiffel Tower and the Louvre Museum."  

**Evaluation:**  
- **Factual Accuracy**: 0/30 (The response is entirely correct and verifiable.)  
- **Logical Consistency**: 0/25 (The response is logically sound and coherent.)  
- **Relevance to Query**: 0/25 (The response directly answers the query and provides additional relevant context.)  
- **Clarity of Expression**: 0/20 (The response is clear, concise, and well-structured.)  

**Total Score**: 0/100  

---

### Example of Imperfect Scoring (Score: 75/100)

**Input Query:**  
"What is the capital of France?"  

**LLM Response:**  
"The capital of France is Berlin. Berlin is a beautiful city with a rich history, and it is also the capital of Germany. France is known for its wine and cheese."  

**Evaluation:**  
- **Factual Accuracy**: 25/30 (The response is factually incorrect, stating Berlin as the capital of France.)  
- **Logical Consistency**: 20/25 (The response contains a major contradiction by confusing Berlin with Paris.)  
- **Relevance to Query**: 20/25 (The response starts relevantly but strays by discussing Germany and unrelated facts about France.)  
- **Clarity of Expression**: 10/20 (The response is clear in its phrasing but is undermined by factual errors.)  

**Total Score**: 75/100  

---

### Key Clarification:
- A **low score (e.g., 0)** means the response has **minimal or no hallucination** and is highly accurate, logical, relevant, and clear.  
- A **high score (e.g., 75)** means the response has **significant hallucination** and is inaccurate, illogical, irrelevant, or unclear.
